# Delete Twitter account

We haven't really been using the twitter.com/containerssh channel. In light or social media being more and more controversial, I propose that we should create an RSS feed for the containerssh.io website and delete the Twitter account.

## Benefits

- More focus and control of our properties
- Avoid social media

## Drawbacks

- A lot of tech discussions happen on Twitter
- Someone else may take the ContainerSSH username

## Voting

This proposal should be discussed in the comments before enacted.

## Implementation

The Twitter account should only be deleted once our RSS feed is up and we can point people to it. We should post an announcement about the deprecation of Twitter as a ContainerSSH messaging platform.
